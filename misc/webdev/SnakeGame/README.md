# Snake Game
This is very simple project created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript with some small frontend Skills.

It is similar to the Snake game you find in the old keypad mobiles.

## Rules of Play
The arrow keys determine the direction of the snake where its heading.

Just like a simple snake game, where the more you feed the snake, the longer it gets and the more points it gets. But if you hit the wall or its own body the game is over.
